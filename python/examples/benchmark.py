def measure(repeats=20, percentiles=(), timers={'Wall':time.perf_counter, 'CPU':time.process_time}):
    """
    Decorator to benchmark a function.
    
    Parameters:
    - repeats (int): The number of times the function should be executed for each set of parameters.
    - percentiles (tuple): The percentiles to compute on the execution times (e.g., (50, 90, 99)).
    - timers (dict): A dictionary where keys are timer names (e.g., 'Wall', 'CPU') and values are timer functions
                     that measure elapsed time. By default:
                     * 'Wall': Uses time.perf_counter for high-resolution wall-clock time.
                     * 'CPU': Uses time.process_time for CPU time spent by the process.
    
    Returns:
    - A decorated function that prints:
        * Average execution time.
        * Standard deviation time.
        * Minimum and maximum times.
        * Computed percentiles for each timer.
